<strong>1) </strong>Define a problem where you test a hypothesis mean <strong>µ<sub>X </sub>= </strong>(a value you choose) with the <strong>alternate hypothesis µ<sub>X </sub>≠ </strong>(the same value you have chosen) at the level of significance (α<strong>)</strong> of <strong>0.05</strong>, for a sample size N=<strong>11,</strong> by also defining your own values for the standard deviation ( ) and mean ( <strong>) </strong>of the sample. Show whether the hypothesis is <strong>accepted or rejected</strong>.

<em>(Hint: Define and solve a two-sided hypothesis testing question using t(student) distribution. Check </em><em>MAT271E_PART 10.pdf.)</em>

<strong>2) </strong>Define the same problem where you test a hypothesis mean <strong>µ<sub>X </sub>= </strong>(a value you choose) this time with the <strong>alternate hypothesis µ<sub>X </sub>&lt; </strong>(the same value you have chosen), for the same level of significance (α<strong>)</strong> of <strong>0.05</strong>, same sample size N=<strong>11 </strong>and the same standard deviation ( ) and mean ( <strong>)</strong> of the sample. Show whether the hypothesis is <strong>accepted or rejected</strong>.

<strong>3) </strong>Define a problem where you test a hypothesis standard deviation <strong>σ<sub>X</sub>= </strong>(a value you choose) with the <strong>alternate hypothesis σ<sub>X </sub>≠ </strong>(the same value you have chosen) at the level of significance (α<strong>)</strong> of <strong>0.10</strong>, for a sample size N=<strong>15,</strong> by also defining your own values for the standard deviation ( ) of the sample. Show whether the hypothesis is <strong>accepted or rejected</strong>.

<strong>4) </strong>Define the same problem where you test a hypothesis standard deviation <strong>σ<sub>X</sub>=</strong>(a value you choose) this time with the <strong>alternate hypothesis σ<sub>X </sub>&gt; </strong>(the same value you have chosen), for the same level of significance (α<strong>)</strong> of <strong>0.10</strong>, same sample size N=<strong>15</strong>and the same standard deviation ( ) of the sample. Show whether the hypothesis is <strong>accepted or rejected</strong>.
